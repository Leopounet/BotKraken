# BotKraken

A Kraken Bot, I guess.

## Purpose

The aim of this bot is to buy and sell crypto currencies off of Kraken.com in real time. The idea is that it should make the best
Buy possible and the best Sell possible. There is no guarantee, please do not spend more than what you can afford to lose.

## Features

* A simulator that does not use real money. The simulator can use a set of combination of Buy and Sell strategies to determine
which one seems to be optimal
* An easy way to create new Buy and Sell Strategies
* A KrakenAPI that makes it relatively easy to interract with the REST API (not that it was too difficult to be fair)

## Future features

* Actual code that can buy and sell with real money
* More things idk

## Notes

* Use and modify my code as you wish, raise issues if something does not go your way, this project is made for fun, not
to becomre rich
